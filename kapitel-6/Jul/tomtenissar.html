            A nisse (Danish: [ˈne̝sə], Norwegian: [ˈnɪ̂sːə]), tomte (Swedish: [ˈtɔ̂mːtɛ]), tomtenisse, or tonttu
            (Finnish: [ˈtontːu]) is a household spirit from Nordic folklore which has always been described as a small
            human-like creature wearing a red cap and gray clothing, doing house and stable chores, and expecting to be
            rewarded at least once a year around winter solstice (yuletide), with the gift of its favorite food, the
            porridge.

            Although there are several suggested etymologies, nisse may derive from the given name Niels or Nicholas,
            introduced 15-17th century (or earlier in medieval times according to some), hence nisse is cognate to St.
            Nicholas and related to the St. Nicholas Day gift giver to children. In the 19th century the Scandinavian
            nisse became increasingly associated with the Christmas season and Christmas gift giving, its pictorial
            depiction strongly influenced by American Santa Claus in some opinion, evolving into the Julenisse .
